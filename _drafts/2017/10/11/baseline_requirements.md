The original version of the site was designed to be interactive, encouraging users to explore collections by tweaking their queries and seeing immediate results.  For example, a facet list displayed result counts within each facet that responded as users clicked or typed.

However, there were some frustrating obstacles.  The XMLHttpRequest working draft specifications were still working their way through implementation.  Browsers had distinct behaviour and our baseline target browser had limited support.  Rendering results was challenging on older browers that had to be supported, particularly were results had be generated by the DOM.
